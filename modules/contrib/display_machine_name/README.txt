Display Machine Name


INTRODUCTION
=============

The Display Machine Name module enables showing the machine name next to the label on view/form display edit forms. This is useful to identify fields which have the same label which can happen when you are using other modules such as field_group or conditional field types of modules.

A simple checkbox has been added at the bottom of each display to enable viewing of the machine name.

INSTALLATION
